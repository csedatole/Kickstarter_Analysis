## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis was performed by creating a pivot table which highlighted the results of all Kickstarter campaigns (successful, failed, or canceled) based on month of the year. A line graph was then created to display the results of the pivot table, as shown below.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107012216/174175499-61088cdd-532a-40cf-a886-9abadddd3ef1.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis was performed by creating a table with goal ranges from less than $1,000 to more than $50,000. The countifs function was used to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns based on the criteria above. These results were turned into percentages and used to create the line graph shown below.![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107012216/174178798-407931a7-8a4e-40b4-86c9-10074cf4c3b1.png)
